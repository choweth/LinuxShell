Belady's Anomaly:
  Belady's anomaly is when increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in page fault occurances. I believe this occurs because the FIFO queue doesn't monitor the numbers it contains compared to the numbers coming in. 
I did not manage to get to implementing Belady's Anomaly handling. Sorry.
